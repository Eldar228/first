# AUBG Survival Game

This is a repository for AUBG Survival Game. This project aims to completely rewrite the web application using modern full stack technologies.
In the future I plan to write React Native applications using this codebase.

# Technology Stack

### NodeJS + Express.js / .NET CORE
### React + Redux
### Something SQL

# Installation
```git clone https://github.com/ilyanoskov/aubgsurvival ```

```cd aubgsurvival/client ```

```npm install```

Once everything becomes stable enough we will deploy this app to Azure

Let's try to keep things simple, write documentation before commiting the code and keep features and branches separate
