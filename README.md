# AUBG Survival Game

This is a repository for AUBG Survival Game. This project aims to completely rewrite the web application using modern full stack technologies.

# Technology Stack

### NodeJS + Express.js
### ReactJS + HTML + CSS + Bootstrap 4
### MongoDB / Postgres (TBD)
### Middleware
- PassportJS for authentication
### Testing / Development
- Gulp for automated server restart

# Installation
```git clone https://github.com/ilyanoskov/aubgsurvival ```

Installation procedures will change once we start using React, environment variables, etc.

Once everything becomes stable enough we will deploy this app to Heroku

Let's try to keep things simple, write documentation before commiting the code and keep features and branches separate
