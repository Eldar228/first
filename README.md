# AUBG Survival Game

This is a repository for AUBG Survival Game. This project aims to completely rewrite the web application using modern full stack technologies.
In the future I plan to write React Native applications using this codebase.

# Technology Stack

### NodeJS + Express.js 
### React + Redux
### MongoDB

Featuring Docker, Mocha to make things a bit smoother

# Installation
```git clone https://github.com/ilyanoskov/aubgsurvival ```

```cd aubgsurvival/client ```

```npm install```

```npm start```

The front end app will be running on localhost:3000
