# AUBG Survival Game

This is a repository for AUBG Survival Game. This project aims to completely rewrite the web application using modern full stack technologies.

# Technology Stack

- ### NodeJS + Express.js
    - ### ReactJS + HTML + CSS + Bootstrap 4
- ### MongoDB / Postgres (TBD)
    - ### Middleware
    - PassportJS for authentication

# Installation
    ```git clone https://github.com/ilyanoskov/aubgsurvival ```

    Installation procedures will change once we start using React, environment variables, etc.

    Let's try to keep things simple, write documentation before commiting the code and keep features and branches separate
