# AUBG Survival Game

This is a repository for AUBG Survival Game. This project aims to completely rewrite the web application using modern full stack technologies.
In the future I plan to write React Native applications using this codebase.
The client is hosted on Github Pages, using gh-pages branch. The server is hosted on Heroku.
